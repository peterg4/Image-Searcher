First I set up the socket communication between the front and backend, I wanted to be able to send search requests to the backend when I submitted my form.
After, I set up the unsplash API call and wrote the data to a file, then i have socket send a confirmation back to the front end, where the data is read from the 
file and outputted into the angular app. I used bootstrap to design the page and to keep it responsive easily. The hardest part of this lab was figuring out how 
Node.js worked and how it communicates with the frontend. s
